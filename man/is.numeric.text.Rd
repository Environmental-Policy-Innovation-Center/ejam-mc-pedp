\description{
utility to check which elements of vector are numbers, even if stored as text like "01"
}
\details{
Checks which elements of vector contain
only digits or leading/trailing spaces
and have only zero or one period (decimal)
and have only zero or one minus sign,
which must be the first nonspace character if it is there.

Does not matter if stored as text character or numeric, so
number can be stored as text like
"01" or " -1.32"
".3" or "3."
even "." ?
even "-" ?
NOT "-  2" and not "3-1" and not "2.32.6"
}
