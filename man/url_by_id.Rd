\usage{
url_by_id(idx, type = "frs", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{idx}{vector of one or more character strings with pgm_sys_id or registry_id
values (all need to be the same type, as defined by type parameter).
Program ids are like "VA0088986" and frs ids are like "110015787683"}

\item{type}{one word, applies to all. default is frs but can be program or the word other.}

\item{...}{appended to the end of the URL as-is, useful if type is other, for example}

\value{
vector of URLs as strings, same length as id parameter

\details{
url_by_id() is a helper used by locate_by_id()

see \code{\link[=latlon_from_programid]{latlon_from_programid()}} and \code{\link[=latlon_from_regid]{latlon_from_regid()}} in contrast to this.

This function helps use an API to get latest info that is online,
unlike latlon_from_regid() that looks in the last snapshot of
FRS info that the installed EJAM package has, which might be out of date.

This URL is to be used to get xml info back, while latlon_from_programid() etc.
would return a data.frame. See examples

This provides street address too, which latlon_from_regid() does not.

This can use a registry ID or the EPA program ID.
