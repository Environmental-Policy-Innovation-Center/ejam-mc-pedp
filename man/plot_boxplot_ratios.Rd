\title{For the outputs of ejscreenit(), get boxplots of Residential Population Percentages across sites as ratios to US means}
\usage{
plot_boxplot_ratios(
  x,
  selected_dvar_colname = varlist2names("names_d")[1],
  selected_dvar_nicename = selected_dvar_colname,
  towhat_nicename = "US average",
  maxratio = 5,
  wheretext = "Near"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{ratios derived from
a data.frame that is the output of ejscreen analysis, for example:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{df <- ejscreenit(testpoints_5)$table
df <- testoutput_ejscreenapi_plus_5
x <- calc_ratios_to_avg(df)$ratios_d

}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}}

\item{selected_dvar_colname}{default is the first column name of x, such as "Demog.Index"
if given a table with just ratios that are named as regular indicators,
as with output of calc_ratios_to_avg()$ratios_d,
but it tries to figure out if ratios are available and what the base name is
in case output of ejamit() was provided.}

\item{selected_dvar_nicename}{default is the "short" name of selected_dvar_colname
as converted using \code{\link[=fixcolnames]{fixcolnames()}}}

\item{towhat_nicename}{default is "US average"}

\item{maxratio}{largest ratio to plot in case of outliers, so plot looks better}

\item{wheretext}{Use in plot subtitle. Default is "Near" but could be "Within 5km of" for example.
If it is a number, n, it will set wheretext to "Within n miles of"}
}
\value{
same format as output of \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot2::ggplot()}}
}
\description{
boxplots show range of scores here vs range in US overall
}
\details{
See \code{\link[=ejam2boxplot_ratios]{ejam2boxplot_ratios()}} now for ratios plots.

See \code{\link[=plot_boxplot_pctiles]{plot_boxplot_pctiles()}} now espec. for percentiles.

IMPORTANTLY,
NOTE this uses the ratio at each site
USING THE AVERAGE RESIDENT AT THAT SITE,
SO A BOXPLOT SHOWS ONE DOT PER SITE AND THE BOXPLOT IS NOT POP WTD
MEANING IT SHOWS THE MEDIAN AND 75TH PERCENTILE SITE NOT RESIDENT, ETC.

This function originally was used for \code{\link[=ejscreenit]{ejscreenit()}} output, and
was just a quick interim solution that could be replaced.
It assumed colnames were not r variable names.

To communicate whether this is skewed to the right
(more high scores than might expect) also could say that
X\% OF SITES OR PEOPLE have scores in top Y\% of US range, >= 100-Y percentile.
e.g., 20\% of these sites have scores at least in the top 5\% of US scores
(which is more/less than one might expect
\itemize{
\item leaving aside statistical significance
ie whether this could be by chance if sites were randomly picked
from US blockgroups or people's bg scores)
}
}
\examples{
  # x <- testoutput_ejscreenit_50$table # or
  x <- testoutput_ejscreenapi_plus_5
  myradius <- x$radius.miles[1]
  plot_boxplot_ratios(calc_ratios_to_avg(x)$ratios_d, wheretext = myradius)
  #plot_boxplot_ratios(calc_ratios_to_avg(x)$ratios_e, wheretext = myradius)
