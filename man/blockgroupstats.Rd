\title{blockgroupstats (DATA) residential population and environmental indicators for Census blockgroups}
\description{
This is the dataset of residential population data and environmental indicators used by EJSCREEN.
It is a data.table with one row for every US Census blockgroup.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Environmental indicators were provided by EPA.
\item Demographics such as percentages are calculated from Census Bureau data from the American Community Survey
5-year summary file, as documented by EJSCREEN.
\item The EJ Indexes (Summary Indexes) are stored in a separate table, \link{bgej}
}

The source of data for each indicator was documented by EJSCREEN, as archived on these pages:
\itemize{
\item \href{https://web.archive.org/web/20250124090116/https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/ejscreen-change-log}{EJSCREEN Change Log - newest indicators, etc.}
\item \href{https://web.archive.org/web/20250123161322/https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/ejscreen-map-descriptions}{Full list of indicators, with definitions}
\item \href{https://web.archive.org/web/20250123162159/https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/overview-environmental-indicators-ejscreen}{Year and source of each environmental indicator}
}

More about blockgroupstats
\itemize{
\item Version 2.32.6 of EJAM used EPA environmental indicators along with population indicators derived
from 2018-2022 ACS data. Each year this should be re-created as for the latest version.
\item See \code{attributes(blockgroupstats)} to confirm vintage of each dataset
\item Geographic scope includes States, DC, and Puerto Rico (PR), but not any Island Areas (VI, GU, AS, etc.)
\item Column names include \code{bgfips}, \code{bgid} (for join to \link{blockwts} by/on \code{bgid}),
\code{pop}, \code{pctlowinc}, etc.
\item For metadata on each column, see \link{map_headernames}
\item To see definitions of the columns (indicators) and some basic info on each:
}

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{x <- data.frame(
 colname = names(blockgroupstats),
 definition = fixcolnames(names(blockgroupstats), 'r', 'long'),
 varinfo(names(blockgroupstats), info = c("varlist", "varcategory",
 "vartype", "calculation_type", "denominator", "sigfigs", "decimals")))
rownames(x) <- NULL
x[1:20, ]
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

The columns called arealand and areawater are in square meters,
not square miles - to convert units:
\code{convert_units(sum( blockgroupstats$arealand) , "sqm", "sqmi")}
The column called "area" is not used and not documented.
