\title{helps other functions have flexible input parameters - can provide points in a table, points as lat,lon vectors, polygons in a spatial data.frame, or Census units as a fips code vector
figures out which type of inputs were provided, and returns them}
\usage{
sites_from_input(
  sitepoints = NULL,
  lat = NULL,
  lon = NULL,
  shapefile = NULL,
  fips = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sitepoints}{optional data.frame with colnames lat,lon}

\item{lat, lon}{optional vectors of latitudes and longitudes}

\item{shapefile}{optional polygons in a spatial data.frame}

\item{fips}{optional Census units as a fips code vector}
}
\value{
a list with names sitetype, sitepoints, fips, and shapefile.
sitetype is "latlon" or "fips" or "shp" or NULL
others are NULL except the one corresponding to the sitetype
sitepoints would be a data.frame of points in columns lat,lon or NULL
shapefile would be a spatial data.frame "sf" class or NULL
fips would be a vector of Census FIPS codes or NULL
