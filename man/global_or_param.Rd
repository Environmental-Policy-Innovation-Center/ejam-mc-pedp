\details{
This and \code{\link[=get_golem_options]{get_golem_options()}} are very similar tools, useful in server and ui.
See help for \code{\link[=get_global_defaults_or_user_options]{get_global_defaults_or_user_options()}}

\code{\link[=global_or_param]{global_or_param()}} is used a lot in server and also ui (while sometimes
\code{\link[golem:get_golem_options]{golem::get_golem_options()}} had been used instead but now is not, for the same purpose).
It is used generally in ui to set default values for params that
are set in the global_defaults_ files and often can be
modified in the advanced tab. To provide alternative values as
params passed to \code{\link[=ejamapp]{ejamapp()}} you would have to understand the options
by seeing what they are defaulted to in the files and how they are used
as parameters in ui or server. See \code{\link[=ejamapp]{ejamapp()}}

This is much like \code{\link[golem:get_golem_options]{golem::get_golem_options()}}
but \code{\link[=global_or_param]{global_or_param()}} is more flexible/robust since it will,
if vname is not already defined as found
by \code{\link[golem:get_golem_options]{golem::get_golem_options()}}

then as second best, see if it was defined in global_defaults_package
and just not yet stored as golem options because the shiny app has not yet launched.
That lets any function or vignette find the values defined in global_defaults_package.R
even if a shiny app has not yet launched.

Then as a last resort, check if the param called vname is
defined in the search path such as in the
calling or global envt already somehow,
and return that value if it exists.
But if it is not in golem options and not found in search path,
this returns NULL
