\details{
Note \code{sitetype} is not quite the same as the \code{site_method} parameter used in building reports.
\code{site_method} can be one of these: SHP, latlon, FIPS, NAICS, FRS, EPA_PROGRAM, SIC, MACT
\code{sitetype} can be latlon, fips, or shp as returned by \code{\link[=ejamit]{ejamit()}}, but can include
lowercase versions of site_method values too within server code and some function parameters!
