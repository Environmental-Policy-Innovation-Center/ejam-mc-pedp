#' Get State each site is entirely within, quickly, from table of blocks nearby/at/in each site (via blockid, by ejam_uniq_id)
#'
#' @description  Find the 2-character State abbreviation (ST), but only for sites entirely in 1 state.
#'
#' @param sites2blocks data.table or data.frame, like [testoutput_getblocksnearby_10pts_1miles],
#'   from [getblocksnearby()] that has columns ejam_uniq_id and blockid and distance
#'
#' @seealso [state_from_blockid_table()] [state_per_site_for_doaggregate()]
#' @return data.table with columns  ejam_uniq_id, ST
#'
#' @details
#'   This function is for when you need to quickly find out the state each site is in,
#'   to be able to report state percentiles, This can identify the State
#'   each site is located in, based on the states of the nearby blocks (and parent blockgroups).
#'   In many analyses, all the sites will be single-state sites, and this function will be sufficient.
#'
#'   - This function only identifies the State for each site that is entirely in 1 state
#'   (whose included block internal points are all in the same state).
#'
#'   - For each multistate site, this returns NA as the ST.
#'
#'     - For a multistate site defined by radius and latlon (a circular buffer), need lat/lon of site and that is slower,
#'   and handled elsewhere. (And for the rare edge case where you did not save the lat,lon of sites you analyzed,
#'   you would need to approximate those from the lat/lon of the blocks and their distances,
#'   via [latlon_from_s2b()], separately).
#'
#'     - For a multistate site defined by a polygon, it is not entirely clear which state to pick for purposes of reporting state percentiles,
#'   but that is handled elsewhere.
#'
#' Note this is an unexported function.
#'
#' Note that the two functions [state_from_blockid_table()] and [state_from_s2b_bysite()] differ
#'  -- one gets the state info for each unique SITE,
#' and the other gets the state abbreviation of each unique BLOCK:
#'  ```
#' xx = state_from_s2b_bysite(testoutput_getblocksnearby_10pts_1miles)[]
#' NROW(xx)
#' # 10
#' length(unique(testoutput_getblocksnearby_10pts_1miles$ejam_uniq_id))
#' # 10
#'
#' length(EJAM:::state_from_blockid_table(testoutput_getblocksnearby_10pts_1miles))
#' # 1914
#' NROW(testoutput_getblocksnearby_10pts_1miles)
#' # 1914
