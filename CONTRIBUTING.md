The worst that can happen is we’ll politely ask you to change something.
We appreciate all friendly contributions.

## contact information

If you have questions or comments on the non-EPA versions of EJAM and EJSCREEN,

## code repositories and open source contributions

We encourage you to read about this R package and project.
Please see [ejanalysis.org/status](https://www.ejanalysis.org/status) for 
information on the latest versions of EJAM and EJSCREEN, 
and links to documentation and the code repository.

This version of the EJAM package was forked from the last EPA version in mid-2025.
The EPA version of the open source EJAM package repository was archived in mid-2025

## Notes regarding prior (EPA-associated) versions - for reference only: 

Disclaimers and general information from EPA on open source were available as of mid-2025, and links to those old materials are provided below just for reference, even though this version of EJAM is not associated with EPA: 

### Disclaimer for GitHub Repository Content

This non-EPA version of EJAM was forked from the original EPA v2.32.4 version. For that EPA version, the following disclaimer applied, and the limitation on the seal and logo are still relevant to this non-EPA version:

- The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) GitHub project code was provided on an "as is" basis and the user assumes responsibility for its use. EPA has relinquished control of the information and no longer has responsibility to protect the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of the information. Any reference to specific commercial products, processes, or services by service mark, trademark, manufacturer, or otherwise, does not constitute or imply their endorsement, recommendation or favoring by EPA.

- **The EPA seal and logo shall not be used in any manner to imply endorsement of any commercial product or activity by EPA or the United States Government.**

### Disclaimer for App

The following information was provided by EPA as of mid-2025, and is included here for reference only, as this version of EJAM is not associated with EPA -- The old disclaimer was the following: 

- This software/application has been approved for release by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). Although the software has been subjected to rigorous review, the USEPA reserves the right to update the software as needed pursuant to further analysis and review. No warranty, expressed or implied, is made by the USEPA or the U.S. Government as to the functionality of the software and related material nor shall the fact of release constitute any such warranty. Furthermore, the software is released on condition that neither the USEPA nor the U.S. Government shall be held liable for any damages resulting from its authorized or unauthorized use.

### Open-Source Code Policy

The following information was provided by EPA as of mid-2025, and is included here for reference only, as this version of EJAM is not associated with EPA:

- [EPA Info on Open Source Projects](https://github.com/USEPA/open-source-projects) and

- [EPA Interim Guidance on Open Source Code](https://developer.epa.gov/guide/open-source-code/).

- Effective August 8, 2016, the [OMB Mandate: M-16-21; Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf){.uri target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} applies to new custom-developed code created or procured by EPA consistent with the scope and applicability requirements of Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Federal Source Code Policy. In general, it states that all new custom-developed code by Federal Agencies should be made available and reusable as open-source code.

- The EPA specific implementation of OMB Mandate M-16-21 is addressed in the [System Life Cycle Management Procedure](https://www.epa.gov/irmpoli8/policy-procedures-and-guidance-system-life-cycle-management-slcm){.uri target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}. EPA has chosen to use GitHub as its version control system as well as its inventory of open-source code projects. EPA uses GitHub to inventory its custom-developed, open-source code and generate the necessary metadata file that is then posted to code.gov for broad reuse in compliance with OMB Mandate M-16-21.

- If you have any questions or want to read more, see the [EPA Open Source Project Repo](https://github.com/USEPA/open-source-projects){.uri target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} and [EPA's Interim Open Source Code Guidance](https://www.epa.gov/developers/open-source-software-and-epa-code-repository-requirements){.uri target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.
