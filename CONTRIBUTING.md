## Status of EJAM package 2025

*As of mid-2025, content related to the USEPA-hosted open source R package EJAM may be archived and/or unpublished:*

### code repositories and open source contributions

The open source package EJAM was in a repository called [USEPA/EJAM-open](https://github.com/USEPA/EJAM-open), but *that repository will be archived in mid-2025* with no plans for it to be further developed by EPA. Any further development or open source contributions would need to take place elsewhere (not in the EPA repository), such as in forks of the package.

### Open-Source Code Policy

General information from EPA on open source was available here: 

[EPA Info on Open Source Projects](https://github.com/USEPA/open-source-projects) and
[EPA Interim Guidance on Open Source Code](https://developer.epa.gov/guide/open-source-code/).

Effective August 8, 2016, the [OMB Mandate: M-16-21; Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf){.uri target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} applies to new custom-developed code created or procured by EPA consistent with the scope and applicability requirements of Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Federal Source Code Policy. In general, it states that all new custom-developed code by Federal Agencies should be made available and reusable as open-source code.

The EPA specific implementation of OMB Mandate M-16-21 is addressed in the [System Life Cycle Management Procedure](https://www.epa.gov/irmpoli8/policy-procedures-and-guidance-system-life-cycle-management-slcm){.uri target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}. EPA has chosen to use GitHub as its version control system as well as its inventory of open-source code projects. EPA uses GitHub to inventory its custom-developed, open-source code and generate the necessary metadata file that is then posted to code.gov for broad reuse in compliance with OMB Mandate M-16-21.

If you have any questions or want to read more, see the [EPA Open Source Project Repo](https://github.com/USEPA/open-source-projects){.uri target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} and [EPA's Interim Open Source Code Guidance](https://www.epa.gov/developers/open-source-software-and-epa-code-repository-requirements){.uri target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.
