#  title was 
# Environmental and Residential Population Analysis Multisite tool
# Environmental Justice Analysis Multisite tool

# Developer note: 
# If you use index.Rmd or README.Rmd it is your responsibility to 
# knit the document to create the corresponding .md. 
# pkgdown does not do this for you because it only touches 
# files in the ⁠doc/⁠ directory.
#
# 1) Edit your README.Rmd file (the .Rmd NOT the .md file)
# 2) Build your README.md file from the README.Rmd file, by clicking Knit in RStudio
#   also check     devtools::build_readme()  ?
#
# 3) Commit both your README.Rmd and README.md
#
# You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render
# `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here:
# <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
#
# Then... 
#    - **See ?pkgdown::build_site** - EJAM now uses the pkgdown R package to build help and vignettes as web pages, and it uses the README.md (not .Rmd) to help build the documentation.

The `r as.vector(desc::desc_get("Title"))` lets you easily and quickly see residential population and environmental information aggregated within and across hundreds or thousands of places, all at the same time.

## What Can You Do with EJAM?

[What is EJAM?](`r whatislink`)

## Status of EJAM package after mid-June 2025

See [ejanalysis.org/status](https://ejanalysis.org/status) for more information.

*As of mid-June 2025, content related to what had been the USEPA-hosted open source R package EJAM will be archived (and/or unpublished)*

*Ongoing development since mid-2025 is not associated with EPA*, and that development including any open source contributions, will take place in a separate repository, called [ejanalysis/EJAM](https://github.com/ejanalysis/EJAM), which a non-EPA, detached fork.

### code repositories and open source contributions

See [ejanalysis.org/ejamrepo](https://ejanalysis.org/ejamrepo)

### documentation

See [ejanalysis.org/ejamdocs](https://ejanalysis.org/ejamdocs) for current documentation.

### datasets

See [ejanalysis.com/ejam-code](https://ejanalysis.com/ejam-code)

Until mid-2025, datasets had been in a repository *archived and/or unpublished in mid-2025* ([USEPA/ejamdata](https://github.com/USEPA/ejamdata)) with no plans for it to be further updated by EPA.

### web app hosting

A (non-EPA) version of the EJAM web app may be found via this link: [ejanalysis.org/ejamapp](https://ejanalysis.org/ejamapp)

For information about how to host the web app, see [Deploying the Web App](`r deploylink`)
