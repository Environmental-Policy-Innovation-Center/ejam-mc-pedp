Almost updates data objects documentation organized within file functions/scripts various datasets. Documentation datasets via EJAM/R/data_*.R files generally handled scripts creating/updating datasets. file covers large arrow datasets stored separate repository, also many smaller data objects installed along package /data/ folder. Updating package’s data objects can complicated many different data objects various types formats locations. various data objects need updated various frequencies – yearly (ACS data) others facility IDs locations change (often possible, EPA’s FRS updated). need updated package features/code changes, important data object called map_headernames (turn used update objects names_e). See draft utility EJAM:::pkg_data() view datasets useful: notable data files, code details, objects may need changed ANNUALLY often: Blockgroup Datasets: include datasets included package ?blockgroupstats, usastats, ?statestats, etc.) well larger tables stored separate repository downloaded EJAM package (?bgpts, ?bgej, ?bgid2fips, ?bg_cenpop2020, etc.). created modified using scripts/functions organized within /data-raw/datacreate_0_UPDATE_ALL_DATASETS.R. NOTE: Prior 2025, several key datasets used EJAM obtained EPA’s EJSCREEN data FTP site others directly relevant staff. Many indicators Community Report v2.2 (early 2024) EJSCREEN data provided gdb csv files FTP site, obtained directly EJSCREEN team separate .csv file. code referred /data-raw/datacreate_0_UPDATE_ALL_DATASETS.R assumes basic datasets EPA available, converts datasets actually used EJAM. However, longer available sources, data mostly independently recreated, require combination existing code significant new work. relevant code archived EJSCREEN repositories, creating environmental datasets. code EJAM functions can get ACS datasets. Much relevant code older non-EPA package called ejscreen, made private early 2025 refreshed. package tools ejscreen.create() able reproduce parts blockgroupstats usastats/statestats datasets. Block Datasets: block (blockgroup) tables might updated less often, Census fips codes change yearly ?blockwts, ?blockpoints, ?quaddata, ?blockid2fips, related additional data.tables updated needed. also done within /data-raw/datacreate_0_UPDATE_ALL_DATASETS.R See package census2020download github function census2020_get_data() may useful. Facilities Datasets: EPA-regulated facilities types sites, NAICS/SIC/MACT/program information, may need frequent updates, ideally, since facilities open, close, relocate, information corrected otherwise updated. EPA’s FRS source much information stored tables EJAM uses, : ?frs, ?frs_by_programid, ?frs_by_naics, ?frs_by_sic, ?frs_by_mact, ?NAICS, ?SIC, ?naics_counts, ?naicstable, ?SIC, ?sictable, ?mact_table, ?epa_programs, ?frsprogramcodes, etc. updated within /data-raw/datacreate_0_UPDATE_ALL_DATASETS.R ?map_headernames associated .xlsx, etc. critical. needs updated especially indicator names change added, example. ?map_headernames holds useful metadata variable (indicator, like %low income) – e.g., many digits use rounding, units, long name indicator, type category indicator, sort order use reports, method calculating aggregations indicator blockgroups, etc. modified directly spreadsheet map_headernames, functions/scripts read .xlsx create map_headernames dataset.

Previously, FIPS codes used ejam_uniq_id sometimes (still outputs functions like ejamit() output table one row per site). Sorting: output sites now sorted like input sites (points, fips, polygons), still usually many rows (blocks) per site. sorted primarily blockid, previously. Invalid sites: outputs getblock… functions consistent – provide sites2blocks data.table output (like ?testoutput_getblocksnearby_10pts_1miles) include sites zero blocks. ejam_uniq_id still correspond input vector, invalid valid site input order, 2 ejam_uniq_id sites2blocks table. FIPS-based functions, though, like getblocksnearby_from_fips(), returning spatial data.frame, include sites output, even blocks, number rows output shapefile match number sites input fips vector. shapes_from_fips() (related) new year parameter, passed [tigris::places()], defaulting 2024 boundaries polygons cities/towns. testoutput_xyz .xlsx .html files dataset R objects like ?testoutput_ejamit_100pts_1miles updated reflect new ?bgej dataset, typo fixes, edits. testinput objects like testinput_fips_counties now vectors per .vector(), longer metadata stored attributes like date_saved_in_package, etc. Adding info via metadata_add() making .vector() FALSE interfered functions expect input vector, like shapes_from_fips().
